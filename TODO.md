# Todo
- Create script to delete saved lineages after 2 months.
- Style the code in italic when editing the code
- Filters/meta tags for salts, category etc in breed dropdown.
- Prebuilt templates.
- Finish adding zombies.
- Optimize popper from triggering on document click.
- Potentially change the breed drop down to a sidebar with all the functionality.
- Add functionality for sprites to be uploaded (and stored only on the client side), enabling artists to preview what their new breed would look like in lineages.
